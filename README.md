# Real TimeBus Tracker
## Description
For my own version of this project, I added a new div that contains information about the weather in Boston at the time the user is visiting the page. I achieved this using an API from openweathermap.org. So now this project not only shows the bus stops on the way from MIT to Harvard on the map but also shows how is the weather in real-time! that way you can decide if it's convenient to wear a jacket or not.
## How to Run
Just put the URL of this project on your browser! to see the animation press the button 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard'.
## Roadmap of future improvements
I am planning to change the icon that shows the bus stops with an image of a bus in the future.
## License information
This project has an MIT license.
