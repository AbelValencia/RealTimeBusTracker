# Real TimeBus Tracker
## Description
This program reveals the bus stops between the MIT and Harvard and also has a div that contains information about the weather in Cambridge, Massachusetts at the time the user is visiting the page. I achieved this using two APIs, one from map box and the other from openweathermap. So now this project not only shows the bus stops on the way from MIT to Harvard on the map but also shows how is the weather in real-time! that way you can decide if it's convenient to wear a jacket or not.
## How to Run
Just put the URL of this project on your browser! to see the animation press the button 'Show stops between MIT and Harvard'.
## Roadmap of future improvements
I am planning to change the icon that shows the bus stops with an image of a bus in the future.
## License information
This project has an MIT license.
